<p><strong>Aims and objectives</strong>
Aims</p>
<ul>
  <li>To undertake within family analyses across all available studies that have sampled related individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p>The consortium aims to help undertake projects using datasets of related individuals. Many of these projects require a lot of data, and more samples than are available in any one study. Therefore the best way to conduct these studies is to run analyses in all available studies, that have capacity to contribute. The model we are currently using is to distribute automated scripts and pipelines to studies to minimize the requirement for analyst time at each study, this federated model all removes the need to transfer data between institutions and countries.</p>
